#### In product page filtration and sorting part is done user can filter the products according to the brands, gender, discount, etc.,  (i.e —clicking on women won’t give you the filter option of gender in the list as gender already got filtered when you clicked on women from the previous page and the same system follows even in the category lists of each filter option). The same goes for the sorting option will sort the products based on the user’s choice of sorting like lowest price first, highest price first and based on discount as well which allow user minimum type to shop.
